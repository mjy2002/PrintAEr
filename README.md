# AE Printer
AE is an open-source vector plotter we re-designed from Thibault Brevets 'Presto'-Project. It handles 60cm plotter paper and offers a 10cm wide placement area to fit in your small paint-buckets (if your using a brush) or the like. There is still lot of room to improve the construction. But so far it proves to be a very solid frame to build upon.
